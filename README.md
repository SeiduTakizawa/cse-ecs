In the example we implemented, we use the MINIMAX algorithm to calculate the optimal move for the computer. The game consists of a 3x3 board where the players (Computer and Human) must form a sequence of characters (ESC or CSE). In this case, we define the Computer as the MAX player in the algorithm, assuming that the Human (MIN) always chooses the optimal move.
